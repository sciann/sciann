# Using Functional to form complex network architectures 

The `Functional` class is designed to allow users to design complex networks with a few lines of code. 

To use Functional, you can follow the exmaple bellow: 

```python
import numpy as np
from sciann import Variable, Functional, SciModel
from sciann.constraints import Data
from sciann.utils import sin, cos, sinh

# Synthetic data to be fitted. 
x_true = np.linspace(0.0, 2*np.pi, 10000)
y_true = np.sin(x_true)

# Functional requires input features to be defined through Variable. 
x = Variable("x", dtype='float32')

# A complex network with 5 hidden layers ([5, 10, 20, 10, 5]), 
# and feature aumentation [x, x**2, x**3, sin(x), cos(x), sinh(x)].
y = Functional(
    "y", 
    [x, x**2, x**3, sin(x), cos(x), sinh(x)],
    hidden_layers = [5, 10, 20, 10, 5],
    activation = 'tanh',
)

# Define the SciModel. 
model = SciModel(x, Data(y))

# Solve the neural network model.
model.train(x_true, y_true, epochs=32, batch_size=1000)

# Find model's prediciton. 
y_pred = model.predict(x_true)
```

Alternatively, you can also evaluate each individual variable after training: 

```python
y_pred = y.eval(model, x_true)
```
